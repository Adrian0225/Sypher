The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer was a model of Imperial-class Star Destroyer in the service of 
the Imperial Navy. A wedge-shaped capital ship, it bristled with weapons emplacements, assault 
troops, boarding craft, and TIE fighter series starfighters. In the era of the Galactic Empire, 
its command bridge was staffed by the finest crewmen in the navy.

At first, Star Destroyers were deployed to sectors and systems caught in the aftermath of the 
Clone Wars, where they would crush any signs of sedition. During the Galactic Civil War the 
Destroyer's role changed to hunting down high value Rebel targets and bases. They fought in 
notable battles such as the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor. The Imperial II-class Star 
Destroyer was a derivative of the Imperial I-class.
